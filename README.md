ESE-527 Capstone Project:

Title：Machine Learning Approaches Towards Google Play Store Apps

Team Member: Chuxuan He, Haipeng Zhao

[Project Background]: 
This project analyzes the Android market based on 10,000+ Google Play App data and 60,000+ customer review data provided by Kaggle, and provides decision-making suggestions to App developers to improve the quality of the user experience.

[Data Processing and Feature Engineering]: 
Use Python to clean missing values, convert data types and standardize numerical features. Use DBSCAN, Isolated forest, KNN to detect outliers and remove them.

[Data Visualization]: 
Use visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create box plots, histograms and conduct exploratory analysis to determine the relationship between Google Apps Ratings and predictive features: User reviews, Size, Number of installs, Price, Category, and so on.
